	<h1 id="top">Brief Introduction</h1>
	<p>I am Manisha Chaturvedi. I am 19 years old. I have recently learnt HTML5 and CSS3, so I have tried to build something with that knowledge. It is just a starting for me. Hope you like it</p>
	<p>My school life started from a very small school name as <span><abbr title="Rai Sister's Montessori School">RSMS </abbr></span> which was situated nearby my house at that time but it has closed now. I did my primary education from there. After that I went to a government school name as <span><abbr title="Sarvodya Kanya Vidyalya">SKV Badli </abbr></span> which is all girls school. I studied there 3 years from 6 <sup>th</sup> to 8 <sup>th</sup>class. And after that I did my rest of the classes from <span><abbr title="Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalya"> RPVV</abbr> sec 11 Rohini </span>. I am really proud of u that I am a ex-RPVVian. I really miss my school life. Here I am giving only a brief introduction if you want to know more then you can go to School life part. </p>
	<p>So the current scenario is very much different from normal life. I am currently in<span> B.Tech </span> 2<sup>nd </sup>year from <span id="college"><abbr title="Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University For Women"> IGDTUW </abbr></span>. I didn't think that I have to see that period also in which we have to study through online mode. Everything has become online. Even my 2<sup>nd </sup>semester examination also conducted through online mode due to this pandemic situation. Nowadays my life is all around phone and laptop. As I have to take online classes then I have to work on building my skills. I am learning front end web development. I have learnt HTML5 & CSS3 from Coursera and working on that more.</p>
