		<h2>Rai Sister's Montessori School</h2>
		<p>My school life started from this school. It was located in Samaypur Badli Delhi-110042. But now it has closed since 2014 due to some financial reasons. I studied there from nursery to 5 <sup>th </sup>class. The school was not so big but sufficient for me. There are many moments with that school. I had 4-5 main friends with whom I roamed very much. We went to our house from school together. Also we were in the same tuition and that's why we talked a lot. We went to tuition together after taking everyone from there home. I really missed those days a lot. We did many things together. Although there were a tough competition for the academics amongst us but then also we enjoyed a lot. That school was not a recognised school that's why I felt too much difficulty for taking admission in another school for further studies. In this period I was very much focused about my academics and all. I was more in just getting marks rather than learning part. I used to just learn things without properly understanding it. So that's all for now in this part...
